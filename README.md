## Project 1: News Classification

In this project, we implemented a news classification system using various Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, RNN, and LSTM. The goal was to classify news articles into different categories based on their content.

- **Dataset**: We used a dataset containing news articles from various sources and categories.
- **Implementation**: We trained the models using scikit-learn and evaluated their performance using accuracy metrics.

## Project 2: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

In this project, we performed sentiment analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. We used the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.

- **Dataset**: We used a dataset containing tweets labeled with sentiment labels.
- **Implementation**: We implemented the Naive Bayes algorithm using scikit-learn and evaluated its performance on the Twitter dataset.
